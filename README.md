## Idea
- Simple CRUD app that allows users to track different attributes commonly associated with high quality coffee such as:
  - Roaster
  - Roast date
  - Brew date
  - Brew method
  - Price
  - Tasting notes
- Users will be able to add new coffees, see a full list (dashboard style) view of all coffees, and modify/delete existing coffees
